# Layouts
reagraph has the following layout types:

- Force Directed 2D
- Force Directed 3D
- Circular 2D
- Tree Top Down 2D
- Tree Left Right 2D
- Tree Top Down 3D
- Tree Left Right 3D
- Radial Out 2D
- Radial Out 3D
- Hierarchical Top Down 2D
- Hierarchical Left Right 2D

## Layout Types

### Force Directed 2D
This is the standard force-directed layout which uses [d3-force-3d](https://github.com/vasturiano/d3-force-3d).
This is a modified version of the force directed library from d3 except adds support for three dimensional layouts.

This is a one of the most common layouts used because of the simplicity and flexibility that the layout
can support.

### Force Directed 3D
The force directed 3d layout is similar to the 2D version except it adds another dimension. It uses
the same library as the 2D version ( [d3-force-3d](https://github.com/vasturiano/d3-force-3d) ).
The 3D version is useful for very large graphs where many nodes would overlap each other.

### Circular 2d
The circular layout arranges nodes in a circular fashion drawing relationships between the nodes
on the outside of the circle. This layout uses [ngraph.circular.fixed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngraph.circular.fixed).

## Tree 2D
The tree layout is a good way to display a clear parent-child relationship between nodes. This layout uses
[d3-force-3d](https://github.com/vasturiano/d3-force-3d).

## Tree 3D
This layout is the same as the tree 2d except adds another dimension. It uses
[d3-force-3d](https://github.com/vasturiano/d3-force-3d) under the hood for the layout.

## Radial
The radial layout arranges nodes in a circular fashion around the focus node in a radial tree. Each
relationship extends to another level in the tree to show a depedency tree.
This layout uses [d3-force-3d](https://github.com/vasturiano/d3-force-3d).

## Hierarchical 2D
This layout uses [d3-hierarchy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-hierarchy).
